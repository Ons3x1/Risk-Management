(PMI) practice standards are guides to the use of a tool, technique, or process identi ed in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge ( PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition) or other PMI standards. Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project stakeholders. A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speci c Knowledge Area. It provides information on what the signi cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signi cant, when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clari cation, who should perform the process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses.

to ( a ) provide a standard for project management practitioners and other stakeholders that de nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b ) provide a standard that is globally applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure - compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.  This practice standard is organized in three main sections: . Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. . A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. . Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speci c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.  \n",

Management De nition The de nition of Project Risk Management, as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for this practice standard: Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning, identi cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project. The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.  \n",

It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives.  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.  \n",

the value of the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identi cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline. Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate.  \n",

Management process are listed in the chapters dealing with those processes. The general criteria for success include: Recognize the Value of Risk Management Project Risk Management should be recognized as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team members. Individual Commitment/Responsibility Project participants and stakeholders should all accept responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody s responsibility. Open and Honest Communication Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management process. Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. Organizational Commitment Organizational commitment can only be established if risk management is aligned with the organization s goals and values. Project Risk Management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager. Risk Effort Scaled to Project Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization. Integration with Project Management Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum, isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes. These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in  \n",

                             Introduction This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects following the approach described in Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. These principles and concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although the terminology may differ in some details. The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice standard and so is not discussed here.  \n",

Its use in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The de nition of project risk given in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is as follows: Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project s objectives. This de nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project s objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact (though other descriptors are possible, such as likelihood and consequence ). The de nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less speci c but also may give risk to uncertainty. The de nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project s objectives, as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uni ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and ef ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.  Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section .). When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems; opportunities which occur may be called bene ts. Both issues/problems and bene ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.  \n",

overall project risk. Individual risks are speci c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome. Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management, and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances.  \n",

to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters. A wide range of factors in uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project within the range of stakeholders overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project, and the stakeholders sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts, industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk is regarded is usually also strongly in uenced by an organization s culture. Different organizations are more or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied.  Understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning that precedes risk identi cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder satisfaction with the project s results. These attitudes should be identi ed and managed proactively and deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational.  \n",

circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identi ed may change. As a result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identi cation and analysis of risks should be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signi cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process. The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management reviews and updates.  \n",

place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication throughout the process. Risk identi cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure that nothing signi cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should be targeted to meet the speci c needs of each stakeholder and should be re ected within the overall project communications strategy with each stakeholder s responsibility and role in risk management identi ed and agreed-upon.  \n",

previously stated. However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk Management. The speci c roles depend on the project team members and other stakeholders place within the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management should be clearly de ned and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable for results. This includes allocating responsibility for speci c activities within the risk process, as well as for resulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use.  \n",



Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management has a role in de ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk Management is a critical success factor for project success. For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact: Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration; Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes; Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project; Allocating resources to tasks; and Reporting progress to stakeholders. None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined during the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management. In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. Outputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS), estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc. are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management.  \n",
              "16  Project Risk Management Processes The de ned steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters. As previously de ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. From this de nition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly de ne the objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements of the process include: Available resources, Methodology and processes used, Tools and techniques used, Supporting infrastructure, Review and update frequency, and Reporting requirements. As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear understanding of the risk thresholds that de ne the key stakeholders views on acceptable levels of risk, as well as a framework against which identi ed risks can be assessed. As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows: De ne those objectives against which risks will be identi ed, De ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this project, and De ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework. The outputs from this initial step should be documented, communicated, and then reviewed by the stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management process. The document should be formally approved at a senior level.  Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying risks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks (such as causes, effects, problems, issues etc.). A variety of risk identi cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speci c project. The aim is to expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and others will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to nd risks which were not evident earlier in the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project. All identi ed risks are recorded. Ideally, a risk owner is designated for each identi ed risk. It is the responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk Management processes. Following risk identi cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize individual risks for further attention, evaluate the level of overall project risk, and determine appropriate responses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination. These two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used, an integrated approach should be adopted. Qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks, considering a range of characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability, timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses. Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identi ed risks on the project outcome. These techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks, interdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required contingency reserve levels, and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions. Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk.  Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood, appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal set of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and opportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics and assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk owner is responsible for de ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition to individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the project plan. It is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented; otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains unchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout the life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identi ed risks, to identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent chapters, as follows: Plan Risk Management (Chapter ) De nes the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process, and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project management. Identify Risks (Chapter ) Identi es as many knowable risks as practicable. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Chapter ) Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks enabling them to be prioritized for further action. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Chapter ) Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the overall project outcome. Plan Risk Responses (Chapter ) Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for each individual risk and for overall project risk, and integrates them into a consolidated project management plan. Monitor and Control Risks (Chapter ) Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in project risk exposure, identi es additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. Figure - shows the ow of control and information between the various steps within the Project Risk Management process.  \n",

Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they t in with the other project management processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest bene t, initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change. Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speci c risk management activities should be established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will de ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modi ed. In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should de ne both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speci c or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan. There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in general, and those for success of Project Risk Management.  Project-Related Criteria. To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and scope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management plan should present these objectives with reference to the project de nition documents. To provide guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also prioritize each project objective. Process-Related Criteria. The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project. The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be in uenced by a number of factors, all of which need to be identi ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the relative importance to them of achieving or missing speci c project objectives. The output of this analysis should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the Project Risk Management processes in the speci c project. Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should re ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of any changes in the stakeholders attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts into account. It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be de ned in a manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis uses such terms as high impact or medium probability, these should be de ned objectively in the risk management plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control. Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management processes should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speci ed risk management objectives. In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond this level. The risk management plan speci es the project s risk management roles and responsibilities and de nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.  Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are de ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly de ned.  \n",

Critical success factors for the Plan Risk Management process are detailed below. .. Identify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless the stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and accept the bene ts of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather than as a passive or reactive component of general project management. A clear de nition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore ensure that valid de nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity. An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use a proprietary or pre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard templates, prede ned risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is required, and a de nition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project. The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as an integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown structure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents.  .. Involve Project Stakeholders in Project Risk Management The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to build on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of, and commitment to, the full Project Risk Management process. The provision for risk management resources speci ed within the risk management plan should be approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes in accordance with agreed-upon objectives. Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of resourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from speci c limitations placed on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved. .. Comply with the Organization s Objectives, Policies, and Practices The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which it is carried out. The rules and guidelines de ned in the risk management plan should be compatible with the culture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals, and objectives. Project management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organization s effective governance. The risk management plan should identify and take into account the relevant organizational procedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or corporate governance processes.  \n",

Planning Sessions Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the project s risk approach between project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk. Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work together since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management process. The participants should include: the project manager, selected project team members and other stakeholders, members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk, and other subject matter experts or facilitators, as needed. At this point, the initial risk responsibilities, methodology, templates, terms, de nitions, time schedules, and cost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted. The speci cation for the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required to ensure their applicability to the speci c project. These should be documented in the risk management plan, which, when formally approved, is the principal deliverable of the Plan Risk Management process.  .. Templates In order to bene t from experience and existing best practice, risk management planning should take into account relevant existing templates for work products, such as risk status reports, risk breakdown structures or the risk register. A decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project, and these should then be adapted and included in the risk management plan.  \n",

managed unless it is rst identi ed. Consequently, after risk management planning has been completed, the rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives. It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) and of externally imposed change. The purpose of risk identi cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process to nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. When a risk is rst identi ed, potential responses may also be identi ed at the same time. These should be recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk Responses process.  \n",

Early Identi cation Risk identi cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the risk identi cation. Early risk identi cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks inherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available for development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances ef ciency since responses taken early are often normally less costly than later ones.  .. Iterative Identi cation Since not all risks can be identi ed at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identi cation is repeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during the Plan Risk Management process. Risk identi cation might also be repeated at key milestones in the project, or whenever there is signi cant change to the project or its operating environment. .. Emergent Identi cation In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as de ned in the project plan, the Project Risk Management process should permit risks to be identi ed at any time, not limited to formal risk identi cation events or regular reviews. .. Comprehensive Identi cation A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that might affect objectives have been identi ed. .. Explicit Identi cation of Opportunities The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered. .. Multiple Perspectives The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that all perspectives are represented and considered. Limiting risk identi cation to the immediate project team is unlikely to expose all knowable risks. .. Risks Linked to Project Objectives Each identi ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, etc.), noting that the PMBOK Guide de nes risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project s objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks process will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective. .. Complete Risk Statement Identi ed risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those responsible for risk assessment and risk response planning. Single words or phrases such as resources or logistics are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk. More detailed risk descriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects.  .. Ownership and Level of Detail Risks can be identi ed at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or high-level description of risk can make it dif cult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create a great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single risk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management. Trigger conditions should also be identi ed where this is possible and appropriate. .. Objectivity All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational biases, where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another, or cognitive biases, where biases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics, may occur. This should be explicitly recognized and addressed during the Identify Risks process. Sources of bias should be exposed wherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively. The aim is to minimize subjectivity, and allow open and honest identi cation of as many risks as possible to the project.  \n",

cation. These fall into the following three categories, as illustrated in Figure -:  .. Historical Review Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects in the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on careful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and ltering of data to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case, the risks identi ed in the selected historical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project. .. Current Assessments Current assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project, analyzing its characteristics against given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty. Unlike historical review approaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on examination of the project. .. Creativity Techniques A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identi cation, which encourages project stakeholders to use their imagination to nd risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator. Each category of risk identi cation technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may choose to use a risk identi cation checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current assessment) and brainstorming (creativity). Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt list, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking.  Whichever risk identi cation techniques are used, it is important that identi ed risks are unambiguously described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or diluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in the form: As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect. The relationship between cause, risk, and effect is shown in  \n",

                                                     Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information currently available for each identi ed risk. The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register. This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also include information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses.  \n",

Risk Analysis Process The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identi ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics. Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter ). One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus on addressing this root cause. Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identi cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure (e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable s scope), facilitating risk response focus in these areas. The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most in uence (positive or negative) on achieving the project s objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk Responses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.  \n",

successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections .. through .., and summarized in a common theme. The agreed-upon approach is the foundation of process credibility. Then, agreed-upon de nitions enable high-quality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process can be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs.  Figure  -. Building Risk Analysis Credibility .. Use Agreed-Upon Approach The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the identi ed risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in determining the importance of a risk as follows: Urgency (proximity). Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the clarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response. Manageability. Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to address them. The project team may examine these and decide to: Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve. Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences. Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view. Impact external to the project. A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond the project. .. Use Agreed-Upon De nitions of Risk Terms The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon de nitions of important terms, and those de nitions should be used consistently when assessing each risk. The use of de nitions, for example, of levels of probability and of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each risk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders.  .. Collect High-Quality Information about Risks Collection of high-quality information about risks is required. Often this information is not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment. Data gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs, the bias should be identi ed and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used. .. Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks. The frequency of this effort will be planned in the Plan Risk Management process, but may also depend on events within the project itself.  \n",

This process is illustrated in  .. Select Risk Characteristics that De ne Risks Importance Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or further analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low). The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management. Most tools assess a risk s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives. .. Collect and Analyze Data Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore, data collection and evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require management support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important when relying on expert judgment for the information. .. Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Speci c Objectives Some tools permit distinguishing a risk s priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides a list of risks that are important for any speci c objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives. .. Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project There are reasons for constructing a measure of a speci c risk s importance to the entire project as contrasted with its importance to speci c objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with management and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should be explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index re ects the organization s preference among objectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk Management process.  .. Categorize Risk Causes Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure (see Identify Risks, Chapter ) can show clusters of priority risks arising from speci c sources. A combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objective s uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis. .. Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify Risks, Chapter ) into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risk s probability of occurring and its potential impact on speci c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identi ed risk is assigned a priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status.  \n",

Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders. It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, the bene ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value justify the additional effort. Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Speci c project risks are usually best understood and quanti ed at a detailed level such as the line-item cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project s budget or the schedule are speci ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quanti ed risks on project objectives. The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires: Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate. Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a level of detail that lends itself to speci c assessment of individual risks. Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements. Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.  Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as: What is the probability of meeting the project s objectives? How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance? What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously? Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk? Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quanti ed risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.

quantitative risk analysis depends explicitly on at least the factors described in Sections .. through ...  .. Prior Risk Identi cation and Qualitative Risk Analysis The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures that the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their effects quantitatively. .. Appropriate Project Model An appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis. Project models most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis include the project schedule (for time), line-item cost estimates (for cost), decision tree (for decisions in the face of uncertainty) and other total-project models. Quantitative risk analysis is especially sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the model of the project that is used. .. Commitment to Collecting High-Quality Risk Data Often high-quality data about risks are not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data requires resources and time as well as management support. .. Unbiased Data Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating that bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias. .. Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the overall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future events are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an overall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are speci ed at the level of the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks.  .. Interrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to each other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur together. This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related, ensuring that they generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements will all experience the effect of that risk together.  \n",

                                               Tools and Techniques for the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Process Tools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics, as follows: .. Comprehensive Risk Representation Risk models permit representation of many, if not all, of the risks that have impact on an objective simultaneously. They also permit the representation of both opportunities and threats to the project s objectives. .. Risk Impact Calculation Quantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks, which are typically identi ed and quanti ed at a level of detail below the total project, on the project objectives, which are typically described at the level of the total project. .. Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Speci cally, the methods should be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an event s occurring or as probability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of line-item costs or schedule activity durations, many of which are uncertain. .. Data Gathering Tools Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops, interviews, or questionnaires to gather quanti ed information for example, on the probability of a risk occurring, a probability distribution of its potential impacts on cost or time, or relationships such as correlation between risks.  .. Effective Presentation of Quantitative Analysis Results Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating. Examples of these are the probability distribution of project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all risks are considered simultaneously, include the following: Probability of achieving a project objective such as nishing on time or within budget. Amount of contingency reserve in cost, time, or resources needed to provide a required level of con dence. Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a sensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis. The elements of a quantitative risk analysis are illustrated in  .. Iterative Quantitative Risk Analysis The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project. Often quantitative risk analysis should be repeated as the project proceeds. The frequency of this effort will be determined during the Plan Risk Management process but will also depend on events within the project itself (see Monitor and Control Risks, Chapter ). .. Information for Response Planning Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be re ected in the project s schedule and budget. Quantitative risk analysis provides information that may be used to modify the project plan. If the overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed, the scope changes are agreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to re ect the new aspects of the project.  \n",

quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated, respectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation for the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources available, changes in the project scope and plan may result. Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response (see Plan Risk Responses, Chapter ) depending on the probability of achieving the plan s objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required to provide the necessary level of con dence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded and passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any further actions required to make full use of these results.  The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority of the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders risk attitudes and the conventions speci ed in the Risk Management Plan, in addition to any constraints and assumptions that were determined when the risks were identi ed and analyzed.  \n",

                                      Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints. Once risks have been identi ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every risk the project team considers to be suf ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response speci cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speci c risk action owner. The risk owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be assigned to a single person. Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the same way as those risks which were initially identi ed. It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identi ed, analyzed, documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.  All the approved, unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following: Project change management and con guration control; Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling; Resource management; and Project communication planning.  \n",

These are described in Sections .. through .. and shown in .. Communicate Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders. In addition, if organizational causes of risks, such as culture, attitudes, or disagreements concerning objectives are present, they should be addressed openly. This may require involving high levels of the organization s management and other stakeholders.  .. Clearly De ne Risk-Related Roles and Responsibilities The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner. A single risk owner should be assigned to every identi ed risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority of these roles. Management may take ownership of risks with political, organizational causes. In addition, senior management should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves. .. Specify Timing of Risk Responses Agreed-upon responses should be integrated into the project management plan and will therefore be scheduled and assigned for execution. The responses that depend on uncertain conditions should also be monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them. .. Provide Resources, Budget, and Schedule for Responses Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners and risk action owners. Management s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources. .. Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, af nity diagram, or other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process (e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect the probability or impact of other risks. Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent.  The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised. .. Ensure Appropriate, Timely, Effective, and Agreed-Upon Responses In general, responses should be appropriate, timely, cost-effective, feasible, achievable, agreed-upon, assigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria: Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations; Technical feasibility; Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding actions; and Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in the risk pro le of the project. .. Address Both Threats and Opportunities Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid. .. Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the rst response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach. Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical level and integrated into the project management plan (e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This activity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time.  \n",

                                                         Risk Response Strategies The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project- level risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been selected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections .. through .. (see also Fig. -).  .. Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and the project will be able to take advantage of it. .. Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or opportunity. .. Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the probability and/or the impact of an opportunity. .. Accept a Threat or an Opportunity This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails taking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed ahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself. .. Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address overall project risk as follows: Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable. Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk. Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the project priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc. Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level.  \n",

                                             Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows: Creativity tools to identify potential responses, Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response. Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process.  These categories of tools can be used respectively to identify potential responses, select the most appropriate response, translate strategy into planning, and assign the corresponding actions. The steps involved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure .. .. Response Identi cation Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine the optimal set of responses. For this reason, it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity techniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required to evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project s objectives. .. Response Selection Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should take into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and the possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual and secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a prede ned threshold. .. Action Planning Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into existing plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (i.e., integrated into the project management plan) or contingent on a trigger condition and prede ned as a contingency response strategy. .. Ownership and Responsibility Assignment The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for each risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk response is carried out in a timely and effective manner. To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring these conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor and Control Risks process.  The strategic de nition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response. Risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should assess the effectiveness of any actions, decide whether additional actions are required, and keep the project manager informed of the situation.  \n",

response planning is based on the information placed in the risk register during execution of the Identify Risks and Perform Analysis processes. The corresponding risk response information is often referred to as the risk response plan, although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register. .. Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register The response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any interested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities and manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities are clearly identi ed and recorded. .. Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan While developing the detailed set of risk responses, the project-related implications are evaluated for inclusion in a modi ed project management plan. These include costs, resource assignments, scheduling details, and changes to project documentation. Until these changes are formally approved along with the additional risks that they may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete. .. Review and Document Predicted Exposure Once the risk responses have been de ned and integrated into the project management plan, the individual and overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response planning is required, as shown in post-response situation and the potential improvement of the risk exposure assuming that the proposed responses are effective. The evaluation should be documented.  The effectiveness of Project Risk Management depends upon the way the approved plans are carried out. These plans should be executed correctly, reviewed, and updated regularly. If this is carried out correctly, the invested effort will be rewarded and future projects will bene t from this project s experience.  \n",

In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the effectiveness of all of the Project Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current project as well as future ones. For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been de ned, the corresponding set of trigger conditions should have been speci ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as de ned, in a timely manner. Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions should have been included and de ned in the current project management plan. The rst action of risk monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary, such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework. The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speci c risks, apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in a timely manner. In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.  As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant. The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk reassessment, including risk identi cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals, or in response to project events without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for risk reassessment are: Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk, Need to analyze a complex change request, Phase end review, Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current. In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to reassessing the risks. In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or keys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of the current or future projects. At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out with a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the ndings of the periodic audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organization s projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools, level of detail, etc. At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of every risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c) occurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality). The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speci c information with respect to the project s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the corresponding organizational process assets. An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure -.  \n",

Process Critical success factors relate to maintaining risk awareness throughout the project and include the characteristics and capabilities detailed in Sections .. through ... .. Integrate Risk Monitoring and Control with Project Monitoring and Control From the start, the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control project risk. This should be set up early in the project planning cycle, and then adjusted in view of the risk response planning decisions adding, for example, the actions associated with monitoring speci c conditions or metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out, the project schedule should include all of the agreed-upon, response-related actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution and tracked accordingly.  .. Continuously Monitor Risk Trigger Conditions Risk response planning will have de ned a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a prede ned trigger condition. Checking for speci cally de ned risks that may trigger conditional responses is the responsibility of the risk action owner, in close collaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager. .. Maintain Risk Awareness Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team members remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all of the project management decisions. The project s senior-level sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk. Sponsor feedback also motivates the project team by demonstrating senior-level interest in Project Risk Management. Stakeholders perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in which risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore crucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of the responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each stakeholder. This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan.  \n",

                                               Tools and Techniques for the Monitor and Control Risks Process In addition to standard project management monitoring and control capabilities, risk monitoring and controlling requires a focus on the tools which will support its key success factors for tracking overall risk as well as individual risks. .. Managing Contingency Reserves Reserves may have been allocated separately to cover time-related and cost-related risks. Techniques are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the required level of con dence in the success of the project. Tools for managing time buffers should be closely integrated into the project s scheduling techniques, whereas those for managing cost should be compatible with the nancial practices. Tools are required to identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain suf cient. Tools are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner.  .. Tracking Trigger Conditions Trigger conditions and the corresponding metrics are de ned during the Plan Risk Responses process. Tools are required to evaluate and track these conditions against the project baseline or speci ed thresholds, based on actual status. They can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables, such as performance, as well as on project-related features, such as time and cost. .. Tracking Overall Risk Tools are required in order to determine, as the project progresses, whether the responses are having the expected effect on the project s overall level of risk. .. Tracking Compliance In order to monitor the quality of the execution of the risk-related plans and processes, a set of quality metrics such as degree of variation from the baseline, should be tracked and recorded. These metrics will normally have been de ned in the risk management plan.  \n",

The de nition of what this information must include, as well as the storage mechanism, should have been previously speci ed in the risk management plan. The goal is to ensure that the signi cant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data to the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document, report, or other communication vehicle. Typical information includes the following: For each identi ed risk or type of risk, whether it occurred, and, if so, when and how often. All relevant data should be recorded: impact, effectiveness of detection and of response, and any unplanned, additional actions that were carried out. Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions. Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions. Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them. Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions. Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities. Consolidated information should be provided on the level of effort expended. Costs and bene ts to the project of risk management activities should also be provided. This information will need to be archived and indexed in a manner that will facilitate retrieval for easy review during the project, at closure, and for future projects, when the need arises.  "

This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure - compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.  This practice standard is organized in three main sections: . Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. . A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. . Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speci c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives.  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Good Risk Management Practice Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identi cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline. Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management  Speci c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing with those processes. The general criteria for success include: Recognize the Value of Risk Management Project Risk Management should be recognized as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team members. Individual Commitment/Responsibility Project participants and stakeholders should all accept responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody s responsibility. Open and Honest Communication Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management process. Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. Organizational Commitment Organizational commitment can only be established if risk management is aligned with the organization s goals and values. Project Risk Management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager. Risk Effort Scaled to Project Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization. Integration with Project Management Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum, isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes. These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in</td>\n",

              "      <td>De nition of Project Risk The word risk is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The de nition of project risk given in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is as follows: Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project s objectives. This de nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project s objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact (though other descriptors are possible, such as likelihood and consequence ). The de nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less speci c but also may give risk to uncertainty. The de nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project s objectives, as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uni ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and ef ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.  Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section .). When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems; opportunities which occur may be called bene ts. Both issues/problems and bene ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. Individual risks are speci c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome. Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management, and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Stakeholder Risk Attitudes The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters. A wide range of factors in uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project within the range of stakeholders overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project, and the stakeholders sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts, industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk is regarded is usually also strongly in uenced by an organization s culture. Different organizations are more or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied.  Understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning that precedes risk identi cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder satisfaction with the project s results. These attitudes should be identi ed and managed proactively and deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational.</td>\n",

The amount of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identi ed may change. As a result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identi cation and analysis of risks should be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signi cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process. The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management reviews and updates.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Project Risk Management and Project Management All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management has a role in de ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk Management is a critical success factor for project success. For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact: Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration; Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes; Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project; Allocating resources to tasks; and Reporting progress to stakeholders. None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined during the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management. In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. Outputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS), estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc. are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Project Risk Management Processes The de ned steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters. As previously de ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. From this de nition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly de ne the objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements of the process include: Available resources, Methodology and processes used, Tools and techniques used, Supporting infrastructure, Review and update frequency, and Reporting requirements. As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear understanding of the risk thresholds that de ne the key stakeholders views on acceptable levels of risk, as well as a framework against which identi ed risks can be assessed. As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows: De ne those objectives against which risks will be identi ed, De ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this project, and De ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework. The outputs from this initial step should be documented, communicated, and then reviewed by the stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management process. The document should be formally approved at a senior level.  Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying risks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks (such as causes, effects, problems, issues etc.). A variety of risk identi cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speci c project. The aim is to expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and others will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to nd risks which were not evident earlier in the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project. All identi ed risks are recorded. Ideally, a risk owner is designated for each identi ed risk. It is the responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk Management processes. Following risk identi cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize individual risks for further attention, evaluate the level of overall project risk, and determine appropriate responses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination. These two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used, an integrated approach should be adopted. Qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks, considering a range of characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability, timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses. Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identi ed risks on the project outcome. These techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks, interdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required contingency reserve levels, and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions. Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk.  Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood, appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal set of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and opportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics and assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk owner is responsible for de ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition to individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the project plan. It is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented; otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains unchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout the life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identi ed risks, to identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent chapters, as follows: Plan Risk Management (Chapter ) De nes the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process, and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project management. Identify Risks (Chapter ) Identi es as many knowable risks as practicable. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Chapter ) Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks enabling them to be prioritized for further action. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Chapter ) Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the overall project outcome. Plan Risk Responses (Chapter ) Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for each individual risk and for overall project risk, and integrates them into a consolidated project management plan. Monitor and Control Risks (Chapter ) Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in project risk exposure, identi es additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.

              "      <td>Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk Management with all other project management activities. Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they t in with the other project management processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest bene t, initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change. Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speci c risk management activities should be established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will de ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modi ed. In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should de ne both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speci c or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan. There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in general, and those for success of Project Risk Management.  Project-Related Criteria. To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and scope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management plan should present these objectives with reference to the project de nition documents. To provide guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also prioritize each project objective. Process-Related Criteria. The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project. The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be in uenced by a number of factors, all of which need to be identi ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the relative importance to them of achieving or missing speci c project objectives. The output of this analysis should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the Project Risk Management processes in the speci c project. Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should re ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of any changes in the stakeholders attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts into account. It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be de ned in a manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis uses such terms as high impact or medium probability, these should be de ned objectively in the risk management plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control. Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management processes should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speci ed risk management objectives. In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond this level. The risk management plan speci es the project s risk management roles and responsibilities and de nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.  Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are de ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly de ned.</td>\n",

Critical success factors for the Plan Risk Management process are detailed below. .. Identify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless the stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and accept the bene ts of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather than as a passive or reactive component of general project management. A clear de nition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore ensure that valid de nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity. An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use a proprietary or pre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard templates, prede ned risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is required, and a de nition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project. The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as an integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown structure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents.  .. Involve Project Stakeholders in Project Risk Management The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to build on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of, and commitment to, the full Project Risk Management process. The provision for risk management resources speci ed within the risk management plan should be approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes in accordance with agreed-upon objectives. Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of resourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from speci c limitations placed on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved. .. Comply with the Organization s Objectives, Policies, and Practices The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which it is carried out. The rules and guidelines de ned in the risk management plan should be compatible with the culture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals, and objectives. Project management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organization s effective governance. The risk management plan should identify and take into account the relevant organizational procedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or corporate governance processes.</td>\n",

Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work together since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management process. The participants should include: the project manager, selected project team members and other stakeholders, members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk, and other subject matter experts or facilitators, as needed. At this point, the initial risk responsibilities, methodology, templates, terms, de nitions, time schedules, and cost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted.

Consequently, after risk management planning has been completed, the rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives. It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) and of externally imposed change. The purpose of risk identi cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process to nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. When a risk is rst identi ed, potential responses may also be identi ed at the same time. These should be recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate.

Early Identi cation Risk identi cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the risk identi cation. Early risk identi cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks inherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available for development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances ef ciency since responses taken early are often normally less costly than later ones.  .. Iterative Identi cation Since not all risks can be identi ed at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identi cation is repeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during the Plan Risk Management process. Risk identi cation might also be repeated at key milestones in the project, or whenever there is signi cant change to the project or its operating environment. .. Emergent Identi cation In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as de ned in the project plan, the Project Risk Management process should permit risks to be identi ed at any time, not limited to formal risk identi cation events or regular reviews. .. Comprehensive Identi cation A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that might affect objectives have been identi ed. .. Explicit Identi cation of Opportunities The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered. .. Multiple Perspectives The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that all perspectives are represented and considered. Limiting risk identi cation to the immediate project team is unlikely to expose all knowable risks. .. Risks Linked to Project Objectives Each identi ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, etc.), noting that the PMBOK Guide de nes risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project s objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks process will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective. .. Complete Risk Statement Identi ed risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those responsible for risk assessment and risk response planning. Single words or phrases such as resources or logistics are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk. More detailed risk descriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects.  .. Ownership and Level of Detail Risks can be identi ed at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or high-level description of risk can make it dif cult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create a great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single risk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management. Trigger conditions should also be identi ed where this is possible and appropriate. .. Objectivity All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational biases, where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another, or cognitive biases, where biases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics, may occur. This should be explicitly recognized and addressed during the Identify Risks process. Sources of bias should be exposed wherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively. The aim is to minimize subjectivity, and allow open and honest identi cation of as many risks as possible to the project.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Tools and Techniques for the Identify Risks Process A range of tools and techniques is available for risk identi cation. These fall into the following three categories, as illustrated in Figure -:  .. Historical Review Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects in the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on careful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and ltering of data to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case, the risks identi ed in the selected historical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project. .. Current Assessments Current assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project, analyzing its characteristics against given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty. Unlike historical review approaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on examination of the project. .. Creativity Techniques A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identi cation, which encourages project stakeholders to use their imagination to nd risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator. Each category of risk identi cation technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may choose to use a risk identi cation checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current assessment) and brainstorming (creativity). Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt list, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking.  Whichever risk identi cation techniques are used, it is important that identi ed risks are unambiguously described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or diluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in the form: As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect. The relationship between cause, risk, and effect is shown in</td>\n",

              "      <td>Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identi ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics. Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter ). One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus on addressing this root cause. Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identi cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure (e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable s scope), facilitating risk response focus in these areas. The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most in uence (positive or negative) on achieving the project s objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk Responses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.</td>\n",

The agreed-upon approach is the foundation of process credibility. Then, agreed-upon de nitions enable high-quality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process can be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs.  Figure  -. Building Risk Analysis Credibility .. Use Agreed-Upon Approach The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the identi ed risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in determining the importance of a risk as follows: Urgency (proximity). Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the clarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response. Manageability. Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to address them. The project team may examine these and decide to: Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve. Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences. Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view. Impact external to the project. A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond the project. .. Use Agreed-Upon De nitions of Risk Terms The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon de nitions of important terms, and those de nitions should be used consistently when assessing each risk. The use of de nitions, for example, of levels of probability and of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each risk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders.  .. Collect High-Quality Information about Risks Collection of high-quality information about risks is required. Often this information is not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment. Data gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs, the bias should be identi ed and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used. .. Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks. The frequency of this effort will be planned in the Plan Risk Management process, but may also depend on events within the project itself.</td>\n",

This process is illustrated in  .. Select Risk Characteristics that De ne Risks Importance Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or further analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low). The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management. Most tools assess a risk s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives. .. Collect and Analyze Data Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore, data collection and evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require management support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important when relying on expert judgment for the information. .. Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Speci c Objectives Some tools permit distinguishing a risk s priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides a list of risks that are important for any speci c objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives. .. Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project There are reasons for constructing a measure of a speci c risk s importance to the entire project as contrasted with its importance to speci c objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with management and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should be explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index re ects the organization s preference among objectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk Management process.  .. Categorize Risk Causes Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure (see Identify Risks, Chapter ) can show clusters of priority risks arising from speci c sources. A combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objective s uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis. .. Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify Risks, Chapter ) into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risk s probability of occurring and its potential impact on speci c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identi ed risk is assigned a priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Process The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on the objectives of the project, based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously. Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders. It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, the bene ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value justify the additional effort. Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Speci c project risks are usually best understood and quanti ed at a detailed level such as the line-item cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project s budget or the schedule are speci ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quanti ed risks on project objectives. The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires: Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate. Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a level of detail that lends itself to speci c assessment of individual risks. Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements. Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.  Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as: What is the probability of meeting the project s objectives? How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance? What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously? Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk? Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quanti ed risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.

Prior Risk Identi cation and Qualitative Risk Analysis The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures that the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their effects quantitatively. .. Appropriate Project Model An appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis. Project models most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis include the project schedule (for time), line-item cost estimates (for cost), decision tree (for decisions in the face of uncertainty) and other total-project models. Quantitative risk analysis is especially sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the model of the project that is used. .. Commitment to Collecting High-Quality Risk Data Often high-quality data about risks are not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data requires resources and time as well as management support. .. Unbiased Data Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating that bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias. .. Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the overall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future events are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an overall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are speci ed at the level of the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks.  .. Interrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to each other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur together. This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related, ensuring that they generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements will all experience the effect of that risk together.</td>\n",

Comprehensive Risk Representation Risk models permit representation of many, if not all, of the risks that have impact on an objective simultaneously. They also permit the representation of both opportunities and threats to the project s objectives. .. Risk Impact Calculation Quantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks, which are typically identi ed and quanti ed at a level of detail below the total project, on the project objectives, which are typically described at the level of the total project. .. Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Speci cally, the methods should be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an event s occurring or as probability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of line-item costs or schedule activity durations, many of which are uncertain. .. Data Gathering Tools Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops, interviews, or questionnaires to gather quanti ed information for example, on the probability of a risk occurring, a probability distribution of its potential impacts on cost or time, or relationships such as correlation between risks.  .. Effective Presentation of Quantitative Analysis Results Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating. Examples of these are the probability distribution of project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all risks are considered simultaneously, include the following: Probability of achieving a project objective such as nishing on time or within budget. Amount of contingency reserve in cost, time, or resources needed to provide a required level of con dence. Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a sensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis. The elements of a quantitative risk analysis are illustrated in  .. Iterative Quantitative Risk Analysis The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project. Often quantitative risk analysis should be repeated as the project proceeds. The frequency of this effort will be determined during the Plan Risk Management process but will also depend on events within the project itself (see Monitor and Control Risks, Chapter ). .. Information for Response Planning Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be re ected in the project s schedule and budget. Quantitative risk analysis provides information that may be used to modify the project plan. If the overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed, the scope changes are agreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to re ect the new aspects of the project.</td>\n",

Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources available, changes in the project scope and plan may result. Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response (see Plan Risk Responses, Chapter ) depending on the probability of achieving the plan s objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required to provide the necessary level of con dence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded and passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any further actions required to make full use of these results.  The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority of the individual risks and to the overall project risk.

Once risks have been identi ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every risk the project team considers to be suf ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response speci cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speci c risk action owner. The risk owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be assigned to a single person. Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the same way as those risks which were initially identi ed. It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identi ed, analyzed, documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.  All the approved, unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following: Project change management and con guration control; Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling; Resource management; and Project communication planning.</td>\n",

The resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders. In addition, if organizational causes of risks, such as culture, attitudes, or disagreements concerning objectives are present, they should be addressed openly. This may require involving high levels of the organization s management and other stakeholders.  .. Clearly De ne Risk-Related Roles and Responsibilities The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner. A single risk owner should be assigned to every identi ed risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority of these roles. Management may take ownership of risks with political, organizational causes. In addition, senior management should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves. .. Specify Timing of Risk Responses Agreed-upon responses should be integrated into the project management plan and will therefore be scheduled and assigned for execution. The responses that depend on uncertain conditions should also be monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them. .. Provide Resources, Budget, and Schedule for Responses Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners and risk action owners. Management s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources. .. Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, af nity diagram, or other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process (e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect the probability or impact of other risks. Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent.  The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised. .. Ensure Appropriate, Timely, Effective, and Agreed-Upon Responses In general, responses should be appropriate, timely, cost-effective, feasible, achievable, agreed-upon, assigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria: Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations; Technical feasibility; Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding actions; and Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in the risk pro le of the project. .. Address Both Threats and Opportunities Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid. .. Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the rst response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach. Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical level and integrated into the project management plan (e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This activity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Risk Response Strategies The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project- level risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been selected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections .. through .. (see also Fig. -).  .. Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and the project will be able to take advantage of it. .. Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or opportunity. .. Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the probability and/or the impact of an opportunity. .. Accept a Threat or an Opportunity This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails taking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed ahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself. .. Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address overall project risk as follows: Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable. Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk. Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the project priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc. Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows: Creativity tools to identify potential responses, Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response. Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process.  These categories of tools can be used respectively to identify potential responses, select the most appropriate response, translate strategy into planning, and assign the corresponding actions. The steps involved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure .. .. Response Identi cation Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine the optimal set of responses. For this reason, it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity techniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required to evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project s objectives. .. Response Selection Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should take into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and the possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual and secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a prede ned threshold. .. Action Planning Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into existing plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (i.e., integrated into the project management plan) or contingent on a trigger condition and prede ned as a contingency response strategy. .. Ownership and Responsibility Assignment The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for each risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk response is carried out in a timely and effective manner. To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring these conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor and Control Risks process.  The strategic de nition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response. Risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should assess the effectiveness of any actions, decide whether additional actions are required, and keep the project manager informed of the situation.</td>\n",

The corresponding risk response information is often referred to as the risk response plan, although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register. .. Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register The response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any interested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities and manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities are clearly identi ed and recorded. .. Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan While developing the detailed set of risk responses, the project-related implications are evaluated for inclusion in a modi ed project management plan. These include costs, resource assignments, scheduling details, and changes to project documentation. Until these changes are formally approved along with the additional risks that they may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete. .. Review and Document Predicted Exposure Once the risk responses have been de ned and integrated into the project management plan, the individual and overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response planning is required, as shown in post-response situation and the potential improvement of the risk exposure assuming that the proposed responses are effective. The evaluation should be documented.  The effectiveness of Project Risk Management depends upon the way the approved plans are carried out. These plans should be executed correctly, reviewed, and updated regularly. If this is carried out correctly, the invested effort will be rewarded and future projects will bene t from this project s experience.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identi ed risks, monitor residual risks, identify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their effectiveness throughout the project life cycle. In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the effectiveness of all of the Project Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current project as well as future ones. For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been de ned, the corresponding set of trigger conditions should have been speci ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as de ned, in a timely manner. Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions should have been included and de ned in the current project management plan. The rst action of risk monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary, such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework. The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speci c risks, apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in a timely manner. In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.  As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant. The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk reassessment, including risk identi cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals, or in response to project events without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for risk reassessment are: Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk, Need to analyze a complex change request, Phase end review, Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current. In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to reassessing the risks. In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or keys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of the current or future projects. At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out with a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the ndings of the periodic audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organization s projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools, level of detail, etc. At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of every risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c) occurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality). The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speci c information with respect to the project s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the corresponding organizational process assets. An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure -.</td>\n",

Integrate Risk Monitoring and Control with Project Monitoring and Control From the start, the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control project risk. This should be set up early in the project planning cycle, and then adjusted in view of the risk response planning decisions adding, for example, the actions associated with monitoring speci c conditions or metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out, the project schedule should include all of the agreed-upon, response-related actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution and tracked accordingly.  .. Continuously Monitor Risk Trigger Conditions Risk response planning will have de ned a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a prede ned trigger condition. Checking for speci cally de ned risks that may trigger conditional responses is the responsibility of the risk action owner, in close collaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager. .. Maintain Risk Awareness Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team members remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all of the project management decisions. The project s senior-level sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk. Sponsor feedback also motivates the project team by demonstrating senior-level interest in Project Risk Management. Stakeholders perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in which risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore crucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of the responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each stakeholder. This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan.</td>\n",

Managing Contingency Reserves Reserves may have been allocated separately to cover time-related and cost-related risks. Techniques are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the required level of con dence in the success of the project. Tools for managing time buffers should be closely integrated into the project s scheduling techniques, whereas those for managing cost should be compatible with the nancial practices. Tools are required to identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain suf cient. Tools are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner.  ..

They can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables, such as performance, as well as on project-related features, such as time and cost. .. Tracking Overall Risk Tools are required in order to determine, as the project progresses, whether the responses are having the expected effect on the project s overall level of risk. .. Tracking Compliance In order to monitor the quality of the execution of the risk-related plans and processes, a set of quality metrics such as degree of variation from the baseline, should be tracked and recorded.

This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also include information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses.\",\n          \"Responsibility for Project Risk Management It may be considered simplistic to say risk management is everyone s responsibility as previously stated. However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk Management. The speci c roles depend on the project team members and other stakeholders place within the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management should be clearly de ned and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable for results. This includes allocating responsibility for speci c activities within the risk process, as well as for resulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use.\",\n          \"De nition of Project Risk The word risk is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The de nition of project risk given in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is as follows: Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project s objectives. This de nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project s objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact (though other descriptors are possible, such as likelihood and consequence ). The de nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less speci c but also may give risk to uncertainty. The de nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project s objectives, as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uni ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and ef ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.  Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section .). When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems; opportunities which occur may be called bene ts. Both issues/problems and bene ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project stakeholders. A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speci c Knowledge Area. It provides information on what the signi cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signi cant, when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clari cation, who should perform the process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses.

This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure - compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.  This practice standard is organized in three main sections: . Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. . A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. . Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speci c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.   \n",

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.   \n",
              "3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives.  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.   \n",

As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identi cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline. Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate.   \n",

Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects . This includes project managers , project personnel , contract personnel , supervisors , and other project stakeholders . A PMI practice standard describes processes , activities , inputs , and outputs for a speci c Knowledge Area . Area provides information on what the signi ca nt process , tool , or technique is , what signi does , why signi is signi ca nt , when signi should be performed or executed , and , if necessary for further clari cation , who should perform the process . A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented , leaving process subject for other forums such as handbooks , manuals , and courses . process chapter includes the following sections :  \n",

Management practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes . The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as Management is applied to single projects only . Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , Edition practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects . Chapter   of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . Management practice standard is consistent with standard chapter , emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management . Management is aligned with other PMI practice standards . Figure - compares the purposes of Figure practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks , handbooks , and courses .   Edition practice standard is organized in three main sections : . Introductory material including the framework , purpose , principles , context of , and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . The six processes are as follows : Plan Risk Management , Identify Risks , Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis , Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis , Plan Risk Responses , and Monitor and Control Risks . Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics : ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process ; ( b ) critical success factors for the process ; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process ; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process . . A glossary of terms which are used in Risks practice standard . Risks practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective , comprehensive , and successful Project Risk Management . These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons : . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future . While tools and techniques are constantly evolving , the principles have more stability and persistence . . Different projects , organizations , and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management .

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states : The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events , and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project . In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , project risk is an uncertain event or condition risk , if risk occurs , has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives . Project objectives include scope , schedule , cost , and quality . Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of Management's occurrence , and provide action - oriented information to project managers . Management orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as orientation's impact on objectives .  \n",
              "3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity : Management is essential to successful project management . Management should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents . In Management way , Management becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project , in every phase and in every process group . Many of the project management processes address planning the project , from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close - out . These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and , therefore , processes need to include treatment of project risks . Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions . Therefore , Management builds upon and extends other project management processes . For instance , project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty . Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project . Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes . On the contrary , Project Risk Management requires Management these project management processes ( e.g. scheduling , budgeting , and change management ) be performed at the level of the best practices available . Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to Management's value by taking risk into account . For instance , risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives .   There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects . In the early stages of a project , the level of risk exposure is at level's maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum . level situation does not mean situation a project should not go forward because little is known at project time . Rather , there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications . The more project situation is recognized , the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be . A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle . The earlier in the project life cycle approach the risks are recognized , the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be . Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and information's environment , such as stakeholders , scope , time , and cost , as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints . The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop . plans is true plans as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions , agreements , and contracts in place , the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced . During project execution , risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so project appropriate responses to project can be developed , as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible . Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future . Finally , throughout the project and during project closure , risk - related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice .  \n",

As with all of these processes , Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies . In addition , like the other processes involved in project management , Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project . Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi - cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers , suppliers , and workforces spread around the globe . Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel , establish or modify budgets , make commitments to others outside the project , interact with regulators , and comply with the rules of accounting and law . Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements .   Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis , in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct . Honesty , responsibility , realism , professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management . Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders . This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general , and risk identi cation , analysis , and response , in particular , should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences . Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects . The degree , level of detail , sophistication of tools , and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that Management can add to the outcome . Thus , a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources , time , and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller , short - term , internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline . Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in decisions process remain appropriate .

This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure - compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.  This practice standard is organized in three main sections: . Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. . A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. . Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes.

Introductory material including the framework , purpose , principles , context of , and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . The six processes are as follows : Plan Risk Management , Identify Risks , Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis , Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis , Plan Risk Responses , and Monitor and Control Risks . Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics : ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process ; ( b ) critical success factors for the process ; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process ; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process . . A glossary of terms which are used in Risks practice standard . Risks practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective , comprehensive , and successful Project Risk Management . These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons : . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future . While tools and techniques are constantly evolving , the principles have more stability and persistence . . Different projects , organizations , and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management . In particular , risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects . Risk management will be more effective if management's practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture , processes and assets . There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in Management practice standard . . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context , re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants , for example , joint ventures between commercial and national companies , government and non - government organizations , and the cross - cultural environment often found on these project teams . The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes . Practitioners can establish processes speci c to processes's particular situation , project , or organization and then compare processes with these principles , thus validating processes against good Project Risk Management practice .</td>\n",

              "      <td>Project Risk Management De nition The de nition of Project Risk Management, as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for this practice standard: Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning, identi cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project. The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives.  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Good Risk Management Practice Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identi cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline. Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate.</td>\n",

Its use in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The de nition of project risk given in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is as follows: Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project s objectives. This de nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project s objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact (though other descriptors are possible, such as likelihood and consequence ). The de nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less speci c but also may give risk to uncertainty. The de nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project s objectives, as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uni ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and ef ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.  Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section .). When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems; opportunities which occur may be called bene ts. Both issues/problems and bene ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Resolved_Content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information currently available for each identi ed risk .

Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project stakeholders. A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speci c Knowledge Area. It provides information on what the signi cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signi cant, when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clari cation, who should perform the process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses.

This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure - compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.  This practice standard is organized in three main sections: . Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. . A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. . Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speci c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.   \n",

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.   \n",
              "3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives.  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.   \n",

As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identi cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline. Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate.   \n",

Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects . This includes project managers , project personnel , contract personnel , supervisors , and other project stakeholders . A PMI practice standard describes processes , activities , inputs , and outputs for a speci c Knowledge Area . Area provides information on what the signi ca nt process , tool , or technique is , what signi does , why signi is signi ca nt , when signi should be performed or executed , and , if necessary for further clari cation , who should perform the process . A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented , leaving process subject for other forums such as handbooks , manuals , and courses . process chapter includes the following sections :   \n",

Management practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes . The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as Management is applied to single projects only . Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , Edition practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects . Chapter   of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . Management practice standard is consistent with standard chapter , emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management . Management is aligned with other PMI practice standards . Figure - compares the purposes of Figure practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks , handbooks , and courses .   Edition practice standard is organized in three main sections : . Introductory material including the framework , purpose , principles , context of , and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . The six processes are as follows : Plan Risk Management , Identify Risks , Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis , Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis , Plan Risk Responses , and Monitor and Control Risks . Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics : ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process ; ( b ) critical success factors for the process ; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process ; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process . . A glossary of terms which are used in Risks practice standard . Risks practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective , comprehensive , and successful Project Risk Management . These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons : . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future . While tools and techniques are constantly evolving , the principles have more stability and persistence . . Different projects , organizations , and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management . In particular , risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects . Risk management will be more effective if management's practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture , processes and assets . There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in Management practice standard . . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context , re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants , for example , joint ventures between commercial and national companies , government and non - government organizations , and the cross - cultural environment often found on these project teams . The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes . Practitioners can establish processes speci c to processes's particular situation , project , or organization and then compare processes with these principles , thus validating processes against good Project Risk Management practice .   \n",

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states : The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events , and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project . In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , project risk is an uncertain event or condition risk , if risk occurs , has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives . Project objectives include scope , schedule , cost , and quality . Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of Management's occurrence , and provide action - oriented information to project managers . Management orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as orientation's impact on objectives .   \n",
              "3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity : Management is essential to successful project management . Management should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents . In Management way , Management becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project , in every phase and in every process group . Many of the project management processes address planning the project , from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close - out . These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and , therefore , processes need to include treatment of project risks . Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions . Therefore , Management builds upon and extends other project management processes . For instance , project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty . Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project . Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes . On the contrary , Project Risk Management requires Management these project management processes ( e.g. scheduling , budgeting , and change management ) be performed at the level of the best practices available . Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to Management's value by taking risk into account . For instance , risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives .   There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects . In the early stages of a project , the level of risk exposure is at level's maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum . level situation does not mean situation a project should not go forward because little is known at project time . Rather , there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications . The more project situation is recognized , the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be . A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle . The earlier in the project life cycle approach the risks are recognized , the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be . Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and information's environment , such as stakeholders , scope , time , and cost , as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints . The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop . plans is true plans as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions , agreements , and contracts in place , the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced . During project execution , risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so project appropriate responses to project can be developed , as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible . Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future . Finally , throughout the project and during project closure , risk - related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice .   \n",

As with all of these processes , Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies . In addition , like the other processes involved in project management , Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project . Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi - cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers , suppliers , and workforces spread around the globe . Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel , establish or modify budgets , make commitments to others outside the project , interact with regulators , and comply with the rules of accounting and law . Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements .   Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis , in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct . Honesty , responsibility , realism , professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management . Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders . This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general , and risk identi cation , analysis , and response , in particular , should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences . Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects . The degree , level of detail , sophistication of tools , and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that Management can add to the outcome . Thus , a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources , time , and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller , short - term , internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline . Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in decisions process remain appropriate .   \n",

              "      <td>Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management The purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management is to ( a ) provide a standard for project management practitioners and other stakeholders that de nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b ) provide a standard that is globally applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure - compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.  This practice standard is organized in three main sections: . Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. . A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. . Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speci c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",
              "      <td>Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management The purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management is to ( a ) provide a standard for project management practitioners and other stakeholders Management de nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b ) provide a standard that is globally applicable and consistently applied . Management practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes . The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as Management is applied to single projects only . Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , Edition practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects . Chapter   of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . Management practice standard is consistent with standard chapter , emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management . Management is aligned with other PMI practice standards . Figure - compares the purposes of Figure practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks , handbooks , and courses .   Edition practice standard is organized in three main sections : . Introductory material including the framework , purpose , principles , context of , and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . The six processes are as follows : Plan Risk Management , Identify Risks , Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis , Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis , Plan Risk Responses , and Monitor and Control Risks . Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics : ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process ; ( b ) critical success factors for the process ; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process ; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process . . A glossary of terms which are used in Risks practice standard . Risks practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective , comprehensive , and successful Project Risk Management . These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons : . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future . While tools and techniques are constantly evolving , the principles have more stability and persistence . . Different projects , organizations , and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management . In particular , risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects . Risk management will be more effective if management's practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture , processes and assets . There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in Management practice standard . . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context , re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants , for example , joint ventures between commercial and national companies , government and non - government organizations , and the cross - cultural environment often found on these project teams . The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes . Practitioners can establish processes speci c to processes's particular situation , project , or organization and then compare processes with these principles , thus validating processes against good Project Risk Management practice .</td>\n",

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives.  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identi cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome.

Its use in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The de nition of project risk given in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is as follows: Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project s objectives. This de nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project s objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact (though other descriptors are possible, such as likelihood and consequence ). The de nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less speci c but also may give risk to uncertainty. The de nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project s objectives, as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uni ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and ef ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.  Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section .). When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems; opportunities which occur may be called bene ts. Both issues/problems and bene ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Resolved_Content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information currently available for each identi ed risk .

Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project stakeholders. A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speci c Knowledge Area. It provides information on what the signi cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signi cant, when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clari cation, who should perform the process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses.

This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure - compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.  This practice standard is organized in three main sections: . Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. . A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. . Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speci c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.   \n",

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.   \n",
              "3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives.  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.   \n",

As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identi cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline. Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate.   \n",

Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects . This includes project managers , project personnel , contract personnel , supervisors , and other project stakeholders . A PMI practice standard describes processes , activities , inputs , and outputs for a speci c Knowledge Area . Area provides information on what the signi ca nt process , tool , or technique is , what signi does , why signi is signi ca nt , when signi should be performed or executed , and , if necessary for further clari cation , who should perform the process . A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented , leaving process subject for other forums such as handbooks , manuals , and courses . process chapter includes the following sections :   \n",

Management practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes . The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as Management is applied to single projects only . Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , Edition practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects . Chapter   of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . Management practice standard is consistent with standard chapter , emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management . Management is aligned with other PMI practice standards . Figure - compares the purposes of Figure practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks , handbooks , and courses .   Edition practice standard is organized in three main sections : . Introductory material including the framework , purpose , principles , context of , and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition . The six processes are as follows : Plan Risk Management , Identify Risks , Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis , Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis , Plan Risk Responses , and Monitor and Control Risks . Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics : ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process ; ( b ) critical success factors for the process ; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process ; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process . . A glossary of terms which are used in Risks practice standard . Risks practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective , comprehensive , and successful Project Risk Management . These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons : . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future . While tools and techniques are constantly evolving , the principles have more stability and persistence . . Different projects , organizations , and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management . In particular , risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects . Risk management will be more effective if management's practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture , processes and assets . There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in Management practice standard . . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context , re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants , for example , joint ventures between commercial and national companies , government and non - government organizations , and the cross - cultural environment often found on these project teams . The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes . Practitioners can establish processes speci c to processes's particular situation , project , or organization and then compare processes with these principles , thus validating processes against good Project Risk Management practice .   \n",

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states : The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events , and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project . In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , project risk is an uncertain event or condition risk , if risk occurs , has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives . Project objectives include scope , schedule , cost , and quality . Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of Management's occurrence , and provide action - oriented information to project managers . Management orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as orientation's impact on objectives .   \n",
              "3  Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management Project Risk Management is not an optional activity : Management is essential to successful project management . Management should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents . In Management way , Management becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project , in every phase and in every process group . Many of the project management processes address planning the project , from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close - out . These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and , therefore , processes need to include treatment of project risks . Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions . Therefore , Management builds upon and extends other project management processes . For instance , project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty . Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project . Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes . On the contrary , Project Risk Management requires Management these project management processes ( e.g. scheduling , budgeting , and change management ) be performed at the level of the best practices available . Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to Management's value by taking risk into account . For instance , risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives .   There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects . In the early stages of a project , the level of risk exposure is at level's maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum . level situation does not mean situation a project should not go forward because little is known at project time . Rather , there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications . The more project situation is recognized , the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be . A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle . The earlier in the project life cycle approach the risks are recognized , the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be . Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and information's environment , such as stakeholders , scope , time , and cost , as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints . The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop . plans is true plans as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions , agreements , and contracts in place , the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced . During project execution , risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so project appropriate responses to project can be developed , as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible . Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future . Finally , throughout the project and during project closure , risk - related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice .   \n",

As with all of these processes , Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies . In addition , like the other processes involved in project management , Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project . Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi - cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers , suppliers , and workforces spread around the globe . Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel , establish or modify budgets , make commitments to others outside the project , interact with regulators , and comply with the rules of accounting and law . Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements .   Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis , in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct . Honesty , responsibility , realism , professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management . Effective Project Risk Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders . This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general , and risk identi cation , analysis , and response , in particular , should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in uences . Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects . The degree , level of detail , sophistication of tools , and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that Management can add to the outcome . Thus , a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources , time , and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller , short - term , internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline . Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in decisions process remain appropriate .   \n",

This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter  of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure - compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.  This practice standard is organized in three main sections: . Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. . Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: ( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b ) critical success factors for the process; ( c ) tools and techniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process. . A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: . Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. . Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. . The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speci c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers.

The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states : The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events , and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project . In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition , project risk is an uncertain event or condition risk , if risk occurs , has a positive or negative effect on a project s objectives . Project objectives include scope , schedule , cost , and quality . Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of Management's occurrence , and provide action - oriented information to project managers .

It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives.  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project s life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

Its use in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The de nition of project risk given in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is as follows: Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project s objectives. This de nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project s objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact (though other descriptors are possible, such as likelihood and consequence ). The de nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less speci c but also may give risk to uncertainty. The de nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project s objectives, as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uni ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and ef ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.  Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section .). When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems; opportunities which occur may be called bene ts. Both issues/problems and bene ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Resolved_Content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information currently available for each identi ed risk .

            "Assumptions: Assumptions are factors that, for planning purposes, are considered to be true, real, or  certain without proof or demonstration. Assumptions affect all aspects of project planning and are part of the  progressive elaboration of the project. Project teams frequently identify, document, and validate assumptions  as part of their planning process. Assumptions generally involve a degree of risk.   Beneﬁ t.  Positive effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of an opportunity.   Bias.  During information gathering about risk, the source of information exhibits a preference or an inclination  that inhibits impartial judgment. Types of bias which commonly affect the risk process include cognitive and  motivational bias.   Cause. Events or circumstances which currently exist and which might give rise to risks.   Consequence. See  impact .   Constraint.  The state, quality, or sense of being restricted to a given course of action or inaction. An applicable  restriction or limitation, either internal or external to a project, which will affect the performance of the project  or a process.   Contingency Reserve.  The amount of funds, budget, or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of  overruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to the organization.   Contingency Plan.  A plan developed in anticipation of the occurrence of a risk, to be executed only if speciﬁ c,  predetermined trigger conditions arise.   Decision Tree Analysis.  The decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the  implications of choosing one or another of the available alternatives. It is used when some future scenarios or  outcomes of actions are uncertain. It incorporates probabilities and the cost or rewards of each logical path of  events and future decisions, and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the  relative values of alternative actions.   Effect.  Conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the  associated risk happened.   Emergent Risk. A risk which arises later in a project and which could not have been identiﬁ ed earlier on.   Identify Risks.  The process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their  characteristics.   Impact. A measure of the effect of a risk on one or more objectives if it occurs. Also known as  consequence .   Individual Risk.  A speciﬁ c uncertain event or condition which, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on  at least one project objective.   Issue. See  problem .   Likelihood. See  probability .   Monitor and Control Risks.  The process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identiﬁ ed risks, monitoring  residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the risk process throughout the project life cycle.

            "Response Strategy: A high-level approach to address an individual risk or overall project risk, broken down  into a set of risk actions.   Risk.  An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s  objectives.   Risk Action.  A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an  individual risk or overall project risk.   Risk Action Owner.

The  risk breakdown structure is often tailored to speciﬁ c project types.   Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical,  external, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as  technical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)   Risk Exposure.  A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identiﬁ ed risks on objectives.   Risk Management Plan.  The document describing how Project Risk Management will be structured and  performed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan.

Information in the risk management plan varies by application area and project size. The  risk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks, the results of  risk analysis, and the risk responses.   Risk Metalanguage.  A structured description of a risk which separates cause, risk, and effect. A typical risk  description using risk metalanguage might be in the form: “Because of <cause>, <risk> might occur, which  would lead to <effect>.”   Risk Model.  A representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be  analyzed by quantitative methods.   Risk Owner .

Positive effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of an opportunity.   Bias.  During information gathering about risk, the source of information exhibits a preference or an inclination  that inhibits impartial judgment. Types of bias which commonly affect the risk process include cognitive and  motivational bias.   Cause. Events or circumstances which currently exist and which might give rise to risks.   Consequence. See  impact .   Constraint.  The state, quality, or sense of being restricted to a given course of action or inaction. An applicable  restriction or limitation, either internal or external to a project, which will affect the performance of the project  or a process.   Contingency Reserve.  The amount of funds, budget, or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of  overruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to the organization.   Contingency Plan.  A plan developed in anticipation of the occurrence of a risk, to be executed only if speciﬁ c,  predetermined trigger conditions arise.   Decision Tree Analysis.  The decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the  implications of choosing one or another of the available alternatives. It is used when some future scenarios or  outcomes of actions are uncertain. It incorporates probabilities and the cost or rewards of each logical path of  events and future decisions, and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the  relative values of alternative actions.   Effect.  Conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the  associated risk happened.   Emergent Risk. A risk which arises later in a project and which could not have been identiﬁ ed earlier on.   Identify Risks.  The process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their  characteristics.   Impact. A measure of the effect of a risk on one or more objectives if it occurs. Also known as  consequence .   Individual Risk.  A speciﬁ c uncertain event or condition which, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on  at least one project objective.   Issue. See  problem .   Likelihood. See  probability .   Monitor and Control Risks.  The process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identiﬁ ed risks, monitoring  residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the risk process throughout the project life cycle.   Monte Carlo Analysis.  A technique that computes or iterates the project cost or project schedule many times  using input values, selected at random from probability distributions of possible costs or durations, to calculate  a distribution of possible total project cost or completion dates.   Objective.  Something toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained or a purpose to  be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed.   Opportunity. A condition or situation favorable to the project, a positive set of circumstances, a positive set  of events, a risk that will have a positive impact on project objectives, or a possibility for positive changes.')"

Risk.  An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s  objectives.   Risk Action.  A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an  individual risk or overall project risk.   Risk Action Owner.  The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a  given risk. Also known as “response owner” when the context allows it.   Risk Attitude.  A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals  and groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous  spectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking.   Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  [Tool] A hierarchically organized depiction of the identiﬁ ed project risks  arranged by risk category and subcategory that identiﬁ es the various areas and causes of potential risks. The  risk breakdown structure is often tailored to speciﬁ c project types.   Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical,  external, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as  technical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)   Risk Exposure.

Risk.  An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s  objectives.   Risk Action.  A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an  individual risk or overall project risk.   Risk Action Owner.  The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a  given risk. Also known as “response owner” when the context allows it.   Risk Attitude.  A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals  and groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous  spectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking.   Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  [Tool] A hierarchically organized depiction of the identiﬁ ed project risks  arranged by risk category and subcategory that identiﬁ es the various areas and causes of potential risks. The  risk breakdown structure is often tailored to speciﬁ c project types.   Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical,  external, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as  technical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)   Risk Exposure.  A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identiﬁ ed risks on objectives.   Risk Management Plan.  The document describing how Project Risk Management will be structured and  performed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The risk  management plan can be informal and broadly framed, or formal and highly detailed, based on the needs  of the project. Information in the risk management plan varies by application area and project size. The  risk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks, the results of  risk analysis, and the risk responses.   Risk Metalanguage.  A structured description of a risk which separates cause, risk, and effect. A typical risk  description using risk metalanguage might be in the form: “Because of <cause>, <risk> might occur, which  would lead to <effect>.”   Risk Model.  A representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be  analyzed by quantitative methods.   Risk Owner .

A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an  individual risk or overall project risk.   Risk Action Owner.  The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a  given risk. Also known as “response owner” when the context allows it.   Risk Attitude.  A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals  and groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous  spectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking.   Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  [Tool] A hierarchically organized depiction of the identiﬁ ed project risks  arranged by risk category and subcategory that identiﬁ es the various areas and causes of potential risks. The  risk breakdown structure is often tailored to speciﬁ c project types.   Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical,  external, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as  technical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)   Risk Exposure.  A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identiﬁ ed risks on objectives.   Risk Management Plan.  The document describing how Project Risk Management will be structured and  performed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan.

Overall  project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather  than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations  in project outcome measured in terms of the corresponding objectives.   Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis.  The process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing  and combining their probability of occurrence and impact.   Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis.  The process of numerically analyzing the effect of identiﬁ ed risks on  overall project objectives.   Plan Risk Management. The process of deﬁ ning how to conduct risk management activities for a project.   Plan Risk Responses.  The process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce  threats to project objectives.   Probability. A measure of how likely an individual risk is to occur. Also known as  likelihood .   Problem. Negative effect on a project objective arising from occurrence of a threat.   Project Risk Management.  Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting  risk management planning, identiﬁ cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.

Risk.  An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s  objectives.   Risk Action.  A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an  individual risk or overall project risk.   Risk Action Owner.  The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a  given risk. Also known as “response owner” when the context allows it.   Risk Attitude.  A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals  and groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous  spectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking.   Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  [Tool] A hierarchically organized depiction of the identiﬁ ed project risks  arranged by risk category and subcategory that identiﬁ es the various areas and causes of potential risks. The  risk breakdown structure is often tailored to speciﬁ c project types.   Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical,  external, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as  technical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)   Risk Exposure.  A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identiﬁ ed risks on objectives.   Risk Management Plan.  The document describing how Project Risk Management will be structured and  performed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The risk  management plan can be informal and broadly framed, or formal and highly detailed, based on the needs  of the project. Information in the risk management plan varies by application area and project size. The  risk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks, the results of  risk analysis, and the risk responses.   Risk Metalanguage.  A structured description of a risk which separates cause, risk, and effect. A typical risk  description using risk metalanguage might be in the form: “Because of <cause>, <risk> might occur, which  would lead to <effect>.”   Risk Model.  A representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be  analyzed by quantitative methods.   Risk Owner . The person responsible for ensuring that an appropriate response strategy is selected and  implemented, and for determining suitable risk actions to implement the chosen strategy, with each risk action  assigned to a single risk action owner.', 'keywords': ['Risk Attitude Surveys', 'Risk Attitudes Surveys', 'Stakeholder Risk Attitudes Surveys'], 'figure': [], 'context': 'Principles and Concepts', 'reference': 'Stakeholder Risk Attitudes'})\n",

Risk.  An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s  objectives.   Risk Action.  A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an  individual risk or overall project risk.   Risk Action Owner.  The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a  given risk. Also known as “response owner” when the context allows it.   Risk Attitude.  A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals  and groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous  spectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking.   Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)  [Tool] A hierarchically organized depiction of the identiﬁ ed project risks  arranged by risk category and subcategory that identiﬁ es the various areas and causes of potential risks. The  risk breakdown structure is often tailored to speciﬁ c project types.   Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical,  external, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as  technical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)   Risk Exposure.  A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identiﬁ ed risks on objectives.   Risk Management Plan.  The document describing how Project Risk Management will be structured and  performed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The risk  management plan can be informal and broadly framed, or formal and highly detailed, based on the needs  of the project. Information in the risk management plan varies by application area and project size. The  risk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks, the results of  risk analysis, and the risk responses.   Risk Metalanguage.  A structured description of a risk which separates cause, risk, and effect. A typical risk  description using risk metalanguage might be in the form: “Because of \\u003ccause\\u003e, \\u003crisk\\u003e might occur, which  would lead to \\u003ceffect\\u003e.”   Risk Model.  A representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be  analyzed by quantitative methods.   Risk Owner .

A typical risk  description using risk metalanguage might be in the form: “Because of \\u003ccause\\u003e, \\u003crisk\\u003e might occur, which  would lead to \\u003ceffect\\u003e.”   Risk Model.  A representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be  analyzed by quantitative methods.   Risk Owner . The person responsible for ensuring that an appropriate response strategy is selected and  implemented, and for determining suitable risk actions to implement the chosen strategy, with each risk action  assigned to a single risk action owner.\\u003cbr\\u003eKeywords: Risk Attitude Surveys, Risk Attitudes Surveys, Stakeholder Risk Attitudes Surveys\\u003cbr\\u003eContext: Principles and
